#  Autonomous SLAM Robot with LiDAR and 2-Wheel Drive

This repository contains the source code and hardware design for a custom-built autonomous robot that uses **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** and **LiDAR** to map and navigate its environment. The robot is a 2-wheel differential drive platform powered by ROS 2 and equipped for real-time autonomous navigation.

## 📽️ Demo
